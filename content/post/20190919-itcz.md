**Why is the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) mean position north of the equator? Two differnt theories were proposed to understand this question in the literatures.**

## <span style="color:ORANGERED">1. Positive feedbacks of air-sea interaction </span>

The ITCZ problem involves a **circular chicken-and-egg argument**. The ITCZ stays north of the equator because SST is higher; and the SST is higher north because the ITCZ stays there. The circular argument suggests that air-sea interaction may play a role.

There are several proposed air-sea interaction mechanisms may favor the unstable growth of an antisymmmetric ITCZ mode.

_a) Wind-evaporation-SST (WES) feedback_ ([Xie and Philander 1994][Xie and Philander 1994], [Neelin et al. 1987][Neelin et al. 1987], [Emanuel 1987][Emanuel 1987])

Surface evaporation is a function of SST and wind speed. The interaction of surface wind and SST via evaporation yields a positive feedback as follows. Consider a meridional dipole of SST anomalies with positive north and negative south of the equator. The SST-induced pressure anomalies drive a southerly cross-equatorial wind, which gains an easterly south and westerly north of the equator because of the Coriolis force. Superimposed on the prevailing easterly trades, these wind anomalies increase (decrease) the wind speed south (north) of the equator, intensifying (reducing) evaporative cooling there. This dipole of latent heat flux anomalies acts to amplify the initial SST dipole.

The positive WES feedback is at the center of this ITCZ circular argument since it is very effective in adjusting SST. Surface heat flux is the dominant mechanism for SST changes outside the equatorial upwelling zone, because the general downwelling there makes SST insensitive to changes in thermocline depth.

_b) Meridional wind-upwelling-SST feedback_ ([Chang and Philander 1994][Chang and Philander 1994], [Mitchell and Wallace 1992][Mitchell and Wallace 1992], [Li 1997][Li 1997])

Consider a initial meridional dipole of SST perturbation with positive north and negative south of the equator, a southerly cross-equatorial wind anomaly is induced. This wind anomaly would drive the oceanic Ekman current with surface convergence (divergence) north (south) of equator. This promotes an asymmetry anomalous vertical velocity at bottom of the oceanic surface. An downwelling (upwelling) appears at north (south) of equator and further strengthens initial dipole of SST perturbation.

Contours represent the annual mean field and vectors represent annual harmonics (upward denotes a maximum amplitude in January, rightward in April, and so on)**, From Li (1997)" numbered="false" lightbox="true" width="50%" >}}

_c) Stratus cloud-radiation-SST feedback_ ([Li and Philander 1996][Li and Philander 1996], [Philander 1996][Philander 1996])

The positive feedback between the low-level marine stratus clouds and SST: the lower the SST, the larger the static stability of the lower troposphere, the stronger the atmospheric inversion, and the thicker the deck of low-level stratus clouds; the increase in the clouds further shields the ocean from shortwave radiation and causes even lower SST.

The atmospheric energy flux ([Schneider et al. 2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13636))
$$ div F = S - L - O $$

- $F$ the atmospheric energy flux
- $S$ the net downward shortwave radiation
- $L$ the outgoing longwave radiation
- $O$ the ocean energy transport or storge in the ocean.

$$ \delta \approx - \frac{1}{a} \frac{F_0}{S_0 - L_0 - O_0} $$

The ITCZ position depend on to the first order on the cross-equatorial atmospheric energy flux $F_0$ and on the net energy input to the atmosphere at the equator.

The NH is warmer primarily because the AMOC transports energy northward, up the mean temperature gradient.
