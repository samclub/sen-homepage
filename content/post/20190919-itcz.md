**Why is ITCZ mean position north of the equator? Two differnt theories were proposed to understand this question in the literatures.**

## <span style="color:deepskyblue">1 Effects of asymmetric land mass and coastal geometry </span>

1) Meridional wind-upwelling-SST feedback (Chang and Philander 1994, Li 1997)

2) Wind-evaporation-SST feedback ([Xie and Philander 1994]( https://doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0870.1994.t01-1-00001.x), Neelin et al. 1987, Emmanuel 1987)

{{< figure src="https://d3i71xaburhd42.cloudfront.net/e4313bdb7706b8b8c3ae3771cd8e6f3be032a24d/11-Figure4-1.png" title="Schematic for wind-evaporation-SST feedback." numbered="true" lightbox="true" >}}

Surface evaporation is a function of SST and wind speed. The interaction of surface wind and SST via evaporation yields a positive feedback as follows. Consider a meridional dipole of SST anomalies with positive north and negative south of the equator. The SST-induced pressure anomalies drive a southerly cross-equatorial wind, which gains an easterly south and westerly north of the equator because of the Coriolis force. Superimposed on the prevailing easterly trades, these wind anomalies increase (decrease) the wind speed south (north) of the equator, intensifying (reducing) evaporative cooling there. This dipole of latent heat flux anomalies acts to amplify the initial SST dipole.

This wind- evaporation-SST (WES) feedback is very effective in adjusting SST. Surface heat flux is the dominant mechanism for SST changes outside the equatorial upwelling zone, because the general downwelling there makes SST insensitive to changes in thermocline depth, an important distinction from El Nino.

The ITCZ problem thus involves a circular chicken-and-egg argument. **The ITCZ stays north of the equator because SST is higher; and the SST is higher north because the ITCZ stays there. The positive WES feedback is at the center of this circular argument.**

3) Stratus cloud-radiation-SST feedback (Li and Philander 1996, Philander 1996)

## <span style="color:deepskyblue">2 Atmospheric energy balance and dynamics </span>

The atmospheric energy flux ([Schneider et al. 2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13636))
$$ div F = S - L - O $$

- $F$ the atmospheric energy flux
- $S$ the net downward shortwave radiation
- $L$ the outgoing longwave radiation
- $O$ the ocean energy transport or storge in the ocean.

$$ \delta \approx - \frac{1}{a} \frac{F_0}{S_0 - L_0 - O_0} $$

The ITCZ position depend on to the first order on the cross-equatorial atmospheric energy flux $F_0$ and on the net energy input to the atmosphere at the equator.

The NH is warmer primarily because the AMOC transports energy northward, up the mean temperature gradient.
