WNWR is a software package for inverstigating the Rossby wave propagation in a horizontally non-uniform flow.

## Purpose

- Theoretical interpretation of the physic mechanism of some atmospheric teleconnections
- Influence of the ambient flow on Rossby wave (RW) propagation, for example. the meridional shift of the jet stream, zonal shift of the jet streamfunction
- Role of meridional basic flow on the interaction of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and the Southern Hemisphere (SH), tropics and extratropics.
- The temporal variability of Rossby wave propagation.
- A verification of the wave energy dispersion pathways

We have used it to examine the energy dispersion trajectory in several published papers.

## Availability to the code

The package code is written in Fortran 90 language. For those finding of interest in using the [WNWR package]({{< ref "software/wnwr" >}}), please ask Prof. Jianping Li (Email: [ljp@ouc.edu.cn](mailto:ljp@ouc.edu.cn)) or myself (Email: [zhaos@hawaii.edu](mailto:zhaos@hawaii.edu)) to get the package code. We would appreciated if you can briefly introduce your plan about the use of this package.
