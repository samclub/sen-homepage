Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is an ocean-atmosphere coupled phenomenen in Indian Ocean. [Dr. Saji N Hameed](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Realtime-monitoring-of-the-Indian-Ocean-Dipole) says 2019 could be one of strongest IOD years ever, which may influence the weather and climate over Australia, India, Indonesia, Singapore this year. More information about the ongoing 2019 IOD event can be seen from [Saji N Hameed's blog](http://enformtk.u-aizu.ac.jp/blog/).

In [Saji's post](http://enformtk.u-aizu.ac.jp/blog/2019/08/29/iod-at-last/) on August 29, the classic IOD SST anomaly over Indian Ocean co-occured with the cold SST anomaly over eastern equatorial Pacific in August. It is still hard to conclude the 2019 IOD event is indenpendent with ENSO.
