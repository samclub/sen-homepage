I found a very useful tool to importing publications from bibtex to a hugo-academic blog. It was developed by [Lorenzo Busetto](https://lbusett.netlify.com/) and was first published on in his [Website & Blog](https://lbusett.netlify.com/post/automatically-importing-publications-from-bibtex-to-a-hugo-academic-blog/).
